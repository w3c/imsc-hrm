    <p>This specification specifies an Hypothetical Render Model (HRM) that constrains the presentation complexity of
    documents that conform to any of the TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions ([[IMSC]]).</p>

    <p>The model is not intended as a specification of the processing requirements for implementations. For instance, while the
    model defines a glyph buffer for the purpose of limiting the number of glyphs displayed at any given point in time, it neither
    requires the implementation of such a buffer, nor models the sub-pixel glyph positioning and anti-aliased glyph rendering
    that can be used to produce text output.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the model is not intended to constrain readability complexity.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
    <section>
      <h3>Objective</h3>
  
      <p>The objective of the HRM is to allow subtitle and caption authors
        and providers to verify that the content they provide does not exceed
        defined complexity levels, so that playback systems can render the content
        synchronized with the author-specified display times.</p>
  
      <p>Playback systems include desktop computers, mobile devices and
        home theatre devices.</p>

      <p class="note">The HRM is not a new concept: it has been included in all
      versions and editions of [[IMSC]] and has remained substantially
      unchanged. It is refactored herein to simplify document maintenance.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h3>Why limit the complexity of <a>IMSC Document Instances</a>?</h3>
  
      <p><a>IMSC Document Instances</a> are typically authored by a first party
      and rendered by a second party. Unless both parties agree on the maximum
      complexity of a <a>IMSC Document Instance</a>, it is likely that:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>an <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> authored by a first party will
        exceed the capabilities of the <a>presentation processor</a> of a second
        party, resulting in an incomplete presentation where some subtitles or
        captions might be missing or might be presented too late;</li>

        <li>a first party authors only extremely simple <a>IMSC Document
       Instances</a> in an attempt to ensure a complete presentation across all
        renderers, resulting in a lower quality presentation;</li>
  
        <li>a second party over-provisions their <a>presentation processor</a>
        in order to ensure a complete presentation of all <a>IMSC Document
        Instances</a>, resulting in increased run-time resource usage, code
        complexity, etc.; or</li>
  
        <li>one <a>presentation processor</a> becomes the de-facto reference to
        determine whether the presentation of a <a>IMSC Document Instance</a>
        will succeed, at the expense of other renderers and consistency of
        presentation.</li>
      </ul>

      <figure id='fig-intro'>
        <img src="figures/intro-fig-1.svg" alt="The HRM prevents incomplete presentations of IMSC Instance Documents.">

        <figcaption>
          The HRM allows authors and implementers of <a>presentation
          processors</a> to agree on the maximum complexity of <a>IMSC Document
          Instances</a>.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>As illustrated in <a href="#fig-intro"></a>, by defining a method (the
      HRM) to compute a proxy for the complexity of an <a>IMSC Document
      Instance</a> and specifying a complexity limit based on such proxy:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>authors can ensure that their <a>IMSC Document Instances</a> do not
        exceed this limit;</li>
  
        <li>implementers can design their <a>presentation processors</a> to maximize the
        likelihood that they will be able to render correctly all <a>IMSC Document
        Instances</a> that do not exceed this limit; and</li>
          
        <li>audiences can expect subtitle and caption presentation to match
        the authorial intention.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h3>Why is the HRM needed to limit complexity?</h3>

      <p>The HRM supplements the syntactic and structural constraints imposed in
      [[IMSC]] by imposing constraints on the contents of the presentation.</p>
  
      <p>Because of the temporal and spatial variability of subtitles and
        captions across types of content, territories and languages, it is not
        possible to limit the complexity of an <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> using
        only average values.</p>
  
      <div class="example">
        <p>An average-based constraint of 840 <a>characters</a> per
          minute could be met in multiple ways, with different rendering
          complexities. Contrast two potential approaches:</p>
        <p> In the first, 5
          <a>characters</a> are presented for a fraction of a second, followed by 835
          <a>characters</a> that are then presented for over 59 seconds. This generates a
          high rendering complexity for the 835 <a>characters</a>, since there is only a
          brief time available to paint them.</p>
        <p>In the second, 210 <a>characters</a> must be
          painted every 15 seconds, giving 15 seconds to prepare for the next
          presentation. This has a much lower rendering complexity.</p>
      </div>
  
      <p>The HRM achieves a more accurate representation of the complexity of an
        <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> at any given time by taking into account
        its past complexity in addition to its instantaneous complexity. The
        same approach is commonly used in video to limit bitstream complexity,
        e.g., the Hypothetical Reference Decoder (HRD) specified in
        [[iso14496-10]].
      </p>
    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h3>How does the HRM measure and limit complexity?</h3>
  
      <p>The HRM defines a simple model for the rendering of subtitles and captions, and uses the time it takes to
      render subtitles and captions according to that model as a proxy for the complexity of the subtitles and captions.
      Rendering includes drawing region backgrounds, rendering and copying text, and decoding and copying images.
      Complexity is then limited by requiring that the time to render one subtitle or caption is shorter than the time
      elapsed since the previous subtitle or caption.
      </p>
  
      <p>This simple model requires only a static analysis of the <a>IMSC Document Instance</a>, requires no fetching of
      external resources and does not require the <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> to be actually rendered. Several
      simplifying assumptions are made to achieve this. For example, the model assumes that each <a>character</a> is
      drawn independently, and accounts for that assumption being, in many cases, false, by assigning different render
      speeds for different scripts. In general the model is not intended to capture the actual time that an
      implementation takes to render subtitles and captions, but rather scale with it: a document that is twice as
      complex according to the model would require roughly twice as many resources to actually render. </p>

      <h3>Where is the HRM used?</h3>
  
      <p>The HRM is typically used prior to distribution of the <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> to the end-user, as an
      integral part of authoring and as a quality check before distribution.</p>
    
      <p>When the HRM is used, the consequences of an <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> exceeding the HRM limits depends
      on the context:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>an authoring system might, for example, flag the specific point in
        time where the HRM limits were exceeded;</li>
        <li>the ingest component of a streaming platform might outright reject
        the <a>IMSC Document Instance</a>.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>The HRM is not intended to be used when the <a>IMSC Document
      Instance</a> is presented to end-users since:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>end-users are not concerned with a technical complexity measure,
        just as they are not concerned with video bit-rate, but instead with
        whether the presentation is successful;</li>
        <li>a <a>presentation processor</a> cannot generally reduce the
        complexity of a <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> without impacting the
        presentation.</li>

      <p>The model illustrated in <a href="#fig-hypothetical-render-model"></a> operates on successive
      <a>Intermediate Synchronic Documents</a> E<sub>i</sub> obtained from an input <a>IMSC Document Instance</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a>non-empty ISDs</a> are processed using a simple double buffering model: while a <a>non-empty ISD</a>
        E<sub>n</sub> is being painted into a Front Buffer, the previous <a>non-empty ISD</a> E<sub>m</sub> is available
        for display in a Back Buffer; and</li>
        <li><a>empty ISDs</a> merely disconnect the Back Buffer from the display when presented,
        i.e., presenting an <a>empty ISD</a> is equivalent to presenting nothing.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The model specifies a (hypothetical) time required for completely painting a <a>non-empty ISD</a>
      as a proxy for complexity. Painting includes clearing the Front Buffer, drawing region backgrounds,
      rendering and copying glyphs, and decoding and copying images. Complexity is then limited by requiring that
      painting of <a>non-empty ISD</a> E<sub>n</sub> starts at the presentation time of the previous non-empty
      <a>non-empty ISD</a> E<sub>m</sub> and completes by the presentation time of E<sub>n</sub>.</p>

      <p>In contrast, there is no complexity involved connecting and disconnecting the Back Buffer from the display, and
      thus no complexity associated with <a>empty ISDs</a>.</p>

      <p>Whenever applicable, constraints are specified relative to <dfn data-cite="ttml2#terms-root-container-region">Root
      Container Region</dfn> dimensions, allowing subtitle sequences to be authored independently of
      <dfn data-cite="IMSC#dfn-related-video-object">Related Video Object</dfn>
      resolution.</p>

      <p>To enable scenarios where the same glyphs are used in multiple successive <a data-lt=
      "Intermediate Synchronic Document">Intermediate Synchronic Documents</a>, e.g. to convey a CEA-608/708-style roll-up (see
      [[CEA-608]] and [[CEA-708]]), the Glyph Buffers G<sub>n</sub> and G<sub>n-1</sub> store rendered glyphs across <a data-lt=
      "Intermediate Synchronic Document">Intermediate Synchronic Documents</a>, allowing glyphs to be copied into the Presentation
      Buffer instead of rendered, a more costly operation.</p>

      <p>Similarly, Decoded Image Buffers D<sub>n</sub> and D<sub>n-1</sub> store decoded images across <a data-lt=
      "Intermediate Synchronic Document">Intermediate Synchronic Documents</a>, allowing images to be copied into the Presentation

      Some scripts require combining marks or use a sequence of code points to form a glyph.

      <p class='note'>While DUR<sub>T</sub>(E<sub>n</sub>) is not affected, the choice of font by the <dfn
      data-cite="ttml2#terms-presentation processor">presentation processor</dfn> can increase actual rendering
      complexity at time of presentation. For instance, a cursive font might select different glyphs for a given <a
      data-cite="i18n-glossary#def_grapheme">grapheme</a> (in order to maintain joining or for the start/end of the
      word) even in the <code>Latin</code> script. Conversely the rendering of scripts that fall in the <em>any other
      value</em> category can in practice achieve performance comparable to, say, the <code>Latin</code> script.

        Setting a Normalized Glyph Buffer Size effectively sets a limit on the total number of distinct <a data-lt=
        "glyph">glyphs</a> present in any given <a>Intermediate Synchronic Document</a> E<sub>n</sub>. For example, assuming a
        maximum Normalized Glyph Buffer Size of 1 and the default <code>tts:fontSize</code> of <code>1c</code> are used,
        the font size relative to the
        <a>Root Container Region</a> height is 1/15 , and the maximum number of distinct glyphs that can be buffered is
        1÷(1÷15)<sup>2</sup>=225 glyphs.

      <aside class='example'>
        GCpy effectively sets a limit on animating text. For example, assuming that the <a>Root Container Region</a> is ultimately
        rendered at 1920×1080 resolution and no regions need to have background color painted (so only a CLEAR(E<sub>n</sub>)
        operation is required for the normalized drawing area for the <a>Intermediate Synchronic Document</a>), a GCpy and BDraw of
        12 s<sup>-1</sup> would mean that a group of 160 <a data-lt="glyph">glyphs</a> with a <code>tts:fontSize</code> equal to 5% of the
        <a>Root Container Region</a> height could be moved at most approximately 12 s<sup>-1</sup> ÷ (1 + ( 160 ×
        0.05<sup>2</sup> )) = 8.6 times per second.
      </aside>

      <aside class='example'>
        Ren(G<sub>i</sub>) effectively sets a limit on the text rendering rate. For example, assuming that the <a>Root Container
        Region</a> is ultimately rendered at a 1920×1080 resolution, a Ren(G<sub>i</sub>) of 1.2 s<sup>-1</sup> would mean that at
        most 120 <a data-lt="glyph">glyphs</a> with a fontSize of 108 px (10% of 1080 px and NRGA(G<sub>i</sub>) = 0.01) could be
        rendered every second.

      <section>
        <h3>Impact of non-conformance</h3>
        <p>In a system where <a>IMSC Document Instances</a> are expected to conform to the Hypothetical Render Model, an <a>IMSC
          Document Instance</a> that does not conform to the Hypothetical Render Model might negatively impact accessibility
          during presentation of the <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> and its associated content.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>User customisation of presentation</h3>
        <p>This specification does not attempt to model any additional complexity for <a>presentation processors</a>
          that might arise due to the user customisation of presentation,
          for example as described by [[media-accessibility-reqs]];
          such user customisation is not defined by [[IMSC]].</p>
        <p>Implementers of <a>presentation processors</a>
          that support user customisation of presentation should ensure that those processors are able
          to present <a>IMSC Document Instances</a> that conform to the Hypothetical Render Model,
          even if the customisation effectively increases the complexity of presentation.</p>

    <h2>Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>This specification has no inherent security or privacy implications.</p>
    <p>The algorithm defined within this specification is used for static analysis of a resource.
      This specification does not define any protocol or interface for obtaining such a resource,
      and it does not define any interface for exposing the results of the analysis.
      No personal or sensitive information is processed as part of the algorithm,
      other than any such information that might happen to be part of the <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> being analysed.
      No information is exposed by the algorithm to any origin.
      No scripts are loaded or processed as part of the algorithm
      and no links to external resources are dereferenced.
    </p>
     </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Implementation considerations</h3>
      <p>Implementers of this specification should capture and meet privacy and security requirements for their intended application.
        For example, an implementation could, when reporting on an <a>error</a> encountered during processing of an <a>IMSC Document Instance</a>,
        include a section of the content of an <a>IMSC Document Instance</a> to elaborate the error.
        If that content could include sensitive or personal information,
        the implementation should ensure that any such output is provided using appropriately secure protocols.
        No such reporting is defined or required by this specification.

  <section class="appendix informative">
    <h2>Error Reporting and Exception Handling</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Error Reporting</h3>
      <p>This specification does not define how, or even if, <a>errors</a> should be reported.</p>
      <p>For example, an implementation could stop on the first error encountered,
        or continue to process the <a>IMSC Document Instance</a>
        and report every error.
        Or an implementation could exit with an appropriate status code
        without reporting any details at all.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
      <p>This specification does not define any runtime exceptions,
        or how such exceptions should be handled.</p>
